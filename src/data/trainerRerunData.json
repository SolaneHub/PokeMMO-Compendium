      "It also doesn’t take damage during a Sandstorm.",
      "Thanks to Oblivious, Intimidate doesn’t work on it, so its stats can’t be reduced.",
      "This guide mainly focuses on doing the run with two Mamoswines.",
      "It’s possible to complete the run with just one Mamoswine, but in that case, you’ll need to heal instead of switching.",
      "However, I recommend using two for a smoother run."
