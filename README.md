## 💡 Inspiration

This project was inspired by an existing online Pokemmo Elite Four guide.  
While that resource provided a starting point, I felt there was room for a more user-friendly, interactive, and visually appealing experience — especially for mobile users.

This compendium was built to improve clarity, accessibility, and strategy organization for players across all regions.

## 🔮 TODO

* [ ] Fully integrate Tailwind CSS for consistent and modern UI styling
* [ ] Develop full route coverage and strategic breakdowns for each region (Kanto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova)
* [ ] Expand team options to accommodate diverse strategies and playstyles
* [ ] Add multilingual support (e.g., English, Italian) for broader accessibility
